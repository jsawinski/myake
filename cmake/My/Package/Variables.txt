==================================================================================================================================

CPACK_GENERATOR
                                        List of CPack generators to use. If not specified, CPack will create a set of options following the naming pattern CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME> (e.g. CPACK_BINARY_NSIS) allowing the user to enable/disable individual generators. If the -G option is given on the cpack command line, it will override this variable and any CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME> options.
CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE
                                        The name of the CPack binary configuration file. This file is the CPack configuration generated by the CPack module for binary installers. Defaults to CPackConfig.cmake.
CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME>
                                        CPack generated options for binary generators. The CPack.cmake module generates (when CPACK_GENERATOR is not set) a set of CMake options (see CMake option() command) which may then be used to select the CPack generator(s) to be used when building the package target or when running cpack without the -G option.
CPACK_READELF_EXECUTABLE
                                        Specify the readelf executable path used by CPack. The default value will be CMAKE_READELF when set. Otherwise, the default value will be empty and CPack will use find_program() to determine the readelf path when needed.
CPACK_OBJCOPY_EXECUTABLE
                                        Specify the objcopy executable path used by CPack. The default value will be CMAKE_OBJCOPY when set. Otherwise, the default value will be empty and CPack will use find_program() to determine the objcopy path when needed.
CPACK_OBJDUMP_EXECUTABLE
                                        Specify the objdump executable path used by CPack. The default value will be CMAKE_OBJDUMP when set. Otherwise, the default value will be empty and CPack will use find_program() to determine the objdump path when needed.

                                        =======================================

CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME
                                        The name of the package (or application). If not specified, it defaults to the project name.
CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR
                                        The name of the package vendor. (e.g., "Kitware"). The default is "Humanity".
CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY
                                        The directory in which CPack is doing its packaging. If it is not set then this will default (internally) to the build dir. This variable may be defined in a CPack config file or from the cpack command line option -B. If set, the command line option overrides the value found in the config file.
CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR
                                        Package major version. This variable will always be set, but its default value depends on whether or not version details were given to the project() command in the top level CMakeLists.txt file. If version details were given, the default value will be CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR. If no version details were given, a default version of 0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR having a default value of 0.
CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR
                                        Package minor version. The default value is determined based on whether or not version details were given to the project() command in the top level CMakeLists.txt file. If version details were given, the default value will be CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR, but if no minor version component was specified then CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR will be left unset. If no project version was given at all, a default version of 0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR having a default value of 1.
CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH
                                        Package patch version. The default value is determined based on whether or not version details were given to the project() command in the top level CMakeLists.txt file. If version details were given, the default value will be CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH, but if no patch version component was specified then CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH will be left unset. If no project version was given at all, a default version of 0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH having a default value of 1.
CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION
                                        A description of the project, used in places such as the introduction screen of CPack-generated Windows installers. If not set, the value of this variable is populated from the file named by CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE.
CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE
                                        A text file used to describe the project when CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION is not explicitly set. The default value for CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE points to a built-in template file Templates/CPack.GenericDescription.txt.
CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY
                                        Short description of the project (only a few words). If the CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION variable is set, it is used as the default value, otherwise the default will be a string generated by CMake based on CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME.
CPACK_PACKAGE_HOMEPAGE_URL
                                        Project homepage URL. The default value is taken from the CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL variable, which is set by the top level project() command, or else the default will be empty if no URL was provided to project().
CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME
                                        The name of the package file to generate, not including the extension. For example, cmake-2.6.1-Linux-i686. 
                                        The default value is: ${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME}-${CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION}-${CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME}
CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY
                                        Installation directory on the target system. This may be used by some CPack generators like NSIS to create an installation directory e.g., "CMake 2.5" below the installation prefix. All installed elements will be put inside this directory.
CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON
                                        A branding image that will be displayed inside the installer (used by GUI installers).
CPACK_PACKAGE_CHECKSUM
                                        An algorithm that will be used to generate an additional file with the checksum of the package. The output file name will be:
                                        ${CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME}.${CPACK_PACKAGE_CHECKSUM}
                                        Supported algorithms are those listed by the string(<HASH>) command.
CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE
                                        CPack-time project CPack configuration file. This file is included at cpack time, once per generator after CPack has set CPACK_GENERATOR to the actual generator being used. It allows per-generator setting of CPACK_* variables at cpack time.
CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE
                                        License to be embedded in the installer. It will typically be displayed to the user by the produced installer (often with an explicit "Accept" button, for graphical installers) prior to installation. This license file is NOT added to the installed files but is used by some CPack generators like NSIS. If you want to use UTF-8 characters, the file needs to be encoded in UTF-8 BOM. If you want to install a license file (may be the same as this one) along with your project, you must add an appropriate CMake install() command in your CMakeLists.txt.
CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README
                                        ReadMe file to be embedded in the installer. It typically describes in some detail the purpose of the project during the installation. Not all CPack generators use this file.
CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME
                                        Welcome file to be embedded in the installer. It welcomes users to this installer. Typically used in the graphical installers on Windows and Mac OS X.
CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL
                                        Disables the component-based installation mechanism. When set, the component specification is ignored and all installed items are put in a single "MONOLITHIC" package. Some CPack generators do monolithic packaging by default and may be asked to do component packaging by setting CPACK_<GENNAME>_COMPONENT_INSTALL to TRUE.

CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES
                                        Lists each of the executables and associated text label to be used to create Start Menu shortcuts. For example, setting this to the list ccmake;CMake will create a shortcut named "CMake" that will execute the installed executable ccmake. Not all CPack generators use it (at least NSIS, Inno Setup and WIX do).

CPACK_STRIP_FILES
                                        List of files to be stripped. Starting with CMake 2.6.0, CPACK_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable which enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to TRUE in CMake, so this change is compatible).

CPACK_VERBATIM_VARIABLES
                                        If set to TRUE, values of variables prefixed with CPACK_ will be escaped before being written to the configuration files, so that the cpack program receives them exactly as they were specified. If not, characters like quotes and backslashes can cause parsing errors or alter the value received by the cpack program. Defaults to FALSE for backwards compatibility.

CPACK_THREADS
                                        Number of threads to use when performing parallelized operations, such as compressing the installer package.

                                        =======================================                                    
                                        Variables for Source Package Generators
                                        The following CPack variables are specific to source packages, and will not affect binary packages:

CPACK_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME
                                        The name of the source package. For example cmake-2.6.1.

CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES
                                        List of files in the source tree that will be stripped. Starting with CMake 2.6.0, CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable which enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to TRUE in CMake, so this change is compatible).

CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR
                                        List of generators used for the source packages. As with CPACK_GENERATOR, if this is not specified then CPack will create a set of options (e.g. CPACK_SOURCE_ZIP) allowing users to select which packages will be generated.

CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE
                                        The name of the CPack source configuration file. This file is the CPack configuration generated by the CPack module for source installers. Defaults to CPackSourceConfig.cmake.

CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES
                                        Pattern of files in the source tree that won't be packaged when building a source package. This is a list of regular expression patterns (that must be properly escaped), e.g., /CVS/;/\\.svn/;\\.swp$;\\.#;/#;.*~;cscope.*

                                        =======================================
                                        Variables for Advanced Use
                                        The following variables are for advanced uses of CPack:

CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR
                                        What CMake generator should be used if the project is a CMake project. Defaults to the value of CMAKE_GENERATOR. Few users will want to change this setting.

CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_PROJECTS
                                        List of four values that specify what project to install. The four values are: Build directory, Project Name, Project Component, Directory. If omitted, CPack will build an installer that installs everything.

CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME
                                        System name, defaults to the value of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME, except on Windows where it will be win32 or win64.

CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION
                                        Package full version, used internally. By default, this is built from CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR, CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR, and CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH.

CPACK_TOPLEVEL_TAG
                                        Directory for the installed files.

CPACK_INSTALL_COMMANDS
                                        Extra commands to install components. The environment variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is set to the temporary install directory during execution.

CPACK_INSTALL_SCRIPTS
                                        Extra CMake scripts executed by CPack during its local staging installation. They are executed before installing the files to be packaged. The scripts are not called by a standalone install (e.g.: make install). For every script, the following variables will be set: CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR, CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR and CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (which is set to the staging install directory). The singular form CMAKE_INSTALL_SCRIPT is supported as an alternative variable for historical reasons, but its value is ignored if CMAKE_INSTALL_SCRIPTS is set and a warning will be issued.

                                        See also CPACK_PRE_BUILD_SCRIPTS and CPACK_POST_BUILD_SCRIPTS which can be used to specify scripts to be executed later in the packaging process.

CPACK_PRE_BUILD_SCRIPTS
                                        List of CMake scripts to execute after CPack has installed the files to be packaged into a staging directory and before producing the package(s) from those files. See also CPACK_INSTALL_SCRIPTS and CPACK_POST_BUILD_SCRIPTS.

CPACK_POST_BUILD_SCRIPTS
                                        List of CMake scripts to execute after CPack has produced the resultant packages and before copying them back to the build directory. See also CPACK_INSTALL_SCRIPTS, CPACK_PRE_BUILD_SCRIPTS and CPACK_PACKAGE_FILES.

CPACK_PACKAGE_FILES
                                        List of package files created in the staging directory, with each file provided as a full absolute path. This variable is populated by CPack just before invoking the post-build scripts listed in CPACK_POST_BUILD_SCRIPTS. It is the preferred way for the post-build scripts to know the set of package files to operate on. Projects should not try to set this variable themselves.

CPACK_INSTALLED_DIRECTORIES
                                        Extra directories to install.

CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_REGISTRY_KEY
                                        Registry key used when installing this project. This is only used by installers for Windows. The default value is based on the installation directory.

CPACK_CREATE_DESKTOP_LINKS
                                        List of desktop links to create. Each desktop link requires a corresponding start menu shortcut as created by CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES.

==================================================================================================================================
=== Archive
==================================================================================================================================

CPACK_ARCHIVE_FILE_NAME
CPACK_ARCHIVE_<component>_FILE_NAME
                                        Package file name without extension.

                                        Default:
                                        The default is <CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME>[-<component>], with spaces replaced by '-'.

                                        The extension is determined from the archive format (see list above) and automatically appended to the file name. Note that <component> is all uppercase in the variable name.

CPACK_ARCHIVE_FILE_EXTENSION
                                        Package file extension.

                                        Default:
                                        Default values are given in the list above.

CPACK_ARCHIVE_COMPONENT_INSTALL
                                        Enable component packaging.

                                        Default:
                                        OFF

                                        If enabled (ON) multiple packages are generated. By default a single package containing files of all components is generated.

                                        =======================================
                                        Variables used by CPack Archive generator

CPACK_ARCHIVE_THREADS
                                        The number of threads to use when performing the compression.

CPACK_DEB_COMPONENT_INSTALL
                                        Enable component packaging for CPackDEB

                                        Default: OFF

                                        If enabled (ON) multiple packages are generated. By default a single package containing files of all components is generated.

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_NAME
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_NAME
                                        Set Package control field (variable is automatically transformed to lower case).

                                        Mandatory: Yes

                                        Default:
                                        CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME for non-component based installations

                                        CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_NAME suffixed with -<COMPONENT> for component-based installations.

                                        See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-source

CPACK_DEBIAN_FILE_NAME
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_FILE_NAME
                                        Package file name.

                                        Mandatory: Yes

                                        Default: <CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME>[-<component>].deb

                                        This may be set to: DEB-DEFAULT
                                        Tell CPack to automatically generate the package file name in deb format:

                                        <PackageName>_<VersionNumber>-<DebianRevisionNumber>_<DebianArchitecture>.deb
                                        This setting recommended as the preferred behavior, but for backward compatibility with the CPack DEB generator in CMake prior to version 3.6, this is not the default. Without this, duplicate names may occur. Duplicate files get overwritten and it is up to the packager to set the variables in a manner that will prevent such errors. 

                                        <file-name>[.deb]
                                        Use the given file name.

                                        Changed in version 3.29: The .deb suffix will be automatically added if the file name does not end in .deb or .ipk. Previously the suffix was required.

                                        <file-name>.ipk
                                        New in version 3.10.

                                        Use the given file name. The .ipk suffix is used by the OPKG packaging system.

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_EPOCH
                                        The Debian package epoch

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: None

                                        Optional number that should be incremented when changing versioning schemas or fixing mistakes in the version numbers of older packages.

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_VERSION
                                        The Debian package version

                                        Mandatory: Yes

                                        Default: CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION

                                        This variable may contain only alphanumerics (A-Za-z0-9) and the characters . + - ~ (full stop, plus, hyphen, tilde) and should start with a digit. If CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RELEASE is not set then hyphens are not allowed.

                                        Note For backward compatibility with CMake 3.9 and lower a failed test of this variable's content is not a hard error when both CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RELEASE and CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_EPOCH variables are not set. An author warning is reported instead.
                                        
CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RELEASE
                                        The Debian package release - Debian revision number.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: None

                                        This is the numbering of the DEB package itself, i.e. the version of the packaging and not the version of the content (see CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_VERSION). One may change the default value if the previous packaging was buggy and/or you want to put here a fancy Linux distro specific numbering.

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE
                                        The Debian package architecture

                                        Mandatory: Yes

                                        Default: Output of dpkg --print-architecture (or i386 if dpkg is not found)

                                        CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS for component-based installations.

                                        Note If CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS or more specifically CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS is set for this component, the discovered dependencies will be appended to CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_DEPENDS instead of CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS. If CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_DEPENDS is an empty string, only the automatically discovered dependencies will be set for this component.
                                        Example:

                                        set(CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS "libc6 (>= 2.3.1-6), libc6 (< 2.4)")

CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SECTION
                                        Set Section control field e.g. admin, devel, doc, ...

                                        Mandatory: Yes

                                        Default: devel

                                        See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#s-subsections

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_PRIORITY
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PRIORITY
                                        Set Priority control field e.g. required, important, standard, optional, extra

                                        Mandatory: Yes

                                        Default: optional

                                        See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#s-priorities

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_HOMEPAGE
                                        The URL of the web site for this package, preferably (when applicable) the site from which the original source can be obtained and any additional upstream documentation or information may be found.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS
                                        May be set to ON in order to use dpkg-shlibdeps to generate better package dependency list.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS if set or OFF

                                        Note You may need set CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH to an appropriate value if you use this feature, because if you don't dpkg-shlibdeps may fail to find your own shared libs. See https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/cmake/RPATH-handling
                                        Note You can also set CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS_PRIVATE_DIRS to an appropriate value if you use this feature, in order to please dpkg-shlibdeps. However, you should only do this for private shared libraries that could not get resolved otherwise.
                                        New in version 3.3: Per-component CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS variables.

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS_PRIVATE_DIRS
                                        May be set to a list of directories that will be given to dpkg-shlibdeps via its -l option. These will be searched by dpkg-shlibdeps in order to find private shared library dependencies.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: None

                                        Note You should prefer to set CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH to an appropriate value if you use dpkg-shlibdeps. The current option is really only needed for private shared library dependencies.

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEBUG
                                        May be set when invoking cpack in order to trace debug information during the CPack DEB generator run.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: None

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_PREDEPENDS
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PREDEPENDS
                                        Sets the Pre-Depends field of the Debian package. Like Depends, except that it also forces dpkg to complete installation of the packages named before even starting the installation of the package which declares the pre-dependency.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: An empty string for non-component based installations

                                        CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_PREDEPENDS for component-based installations.

                                        See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_ENHANCES
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_ENHANCES
                                        Sets the Enhances field of the Debian package. Similar to Suggests but works in the opposite direction: declares that a package can enhance the functionality of another package.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: An empty string for non-component based installations

                                        CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_ENHANCES for component-based installations.

                                        See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_BREAKS
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_BREAKS
                                        Sets the Breaks field of the Debian package. When a binary package (P) declares that it breaks other packages (B), dpkg will not allow the package (P) which declares Breaks be unpacked unless the packages that will be broken (B) are deconfigured first. As long as the package (P) is configured, the previously deconfigured packages (B) cannot be reconfigured again.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: An empty string for non-component based installations

                                        CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_BREAKS for component-based installations.

                                        See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-breaks

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_CONFLICTS
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_CONFLICTS
                                        Sets the Conflicts field of the Debian package. When one binary package declares a conflict with another using a Conflicts field, dpkg will not allow them to be unpacked on the system at the same time.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: An empty string for non-component based installations

                                        CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_CONFLICTS for component-based installations.

                                        See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-conflicts

                                        Note This is a stronger restriction than Breaks, which prevents the broken package from being configured while the breaking package is in the "Unpacked" state but allows both packages to be unpacked at the same time.

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_PROVIDES
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PROVIDES
                                        Sets the Provides field of the Debian package. A virtual package is one which appears in the Provides control field of another package.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: An empty string for non-component based installations

                                        CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_PROVIDES for component-based installations.

                                        See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-virtual

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_REPLACES
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_REPLACES
                                        Sets the Replaces field of the Debian package. Packages can declare in their control file that they should overwrite files in certain other packages, or completely replace other packages.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: An empty string for non-component based installations

                                        CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_REPLACES for component-based installations.

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RECOMMENDS
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_RECOMMENDS
                                        Sets the Recommends field of the Debian package. Allows packages to declare a strong, but not absolute, dependency on other packages.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: An empty string for non-component based installations

                                        CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RECOMMENDS for component-based installations.

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS
                                        Sets the Suggests field of the Debian package. Allows packages to declare a suggested package install grouping.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: An empty string for non-component based installations

                                        CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS for component-based installations.

                                        See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_GENERATE_SHLIBS
                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: OFF

                                        Allows to generate shlibs control file automatically. Compatibility is defined by CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_GENERATE_SHLIBS_POLICY variable value.

                                        Note Libraries are only considered if they have both library name and version set. This can be done by setting SOVERSION property with set_target_properties() command.

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_GENERATE_SHLIBS_POLICY
                                        Compatibility policy for auto-generated shlibs control file.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: =

                                        Defines compatibility policy for auto-generated shlibs control file. Possible values: =, >=

                                        See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html#s-sharedlibs-shlibdeps

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_CONTROL_EXTRA
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_CONTROL_EXTRA
                                        This variable allow advanced user to add custom script to the control.tar.gz. Typical usage is for conffiles, postinst, postrm, prerm.

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: None

                                        Usage:

                                        set(CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_CONTROL_EXTRA
                                            "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/prerm;${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/postrm")

                                        This overrides the permissions on the original files, following the rules set by Debian policy https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-files.html#s-permissions-owners

                                        Note The original permissions of the files will be used in the final package unless this variable is set to TRUE. In particular, the scripts should have the proper executable flag prior to the generation of the package.

CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SOURCE
CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SOURCE
                                        Sets the Source field of the binary Debian package.

                                        Packaging of debug information

                                        Dbgsym packages contain debug symbols for debugging packaged binaries.

                                        Dbgsym packaging has its own set of variables:

CPACK_DEBIAN_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE
CPACK_DEBIAN_<component>_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE
                                        Enable generation of dbgsym .ddeb package(s).

                                        Mandatory: No

                                        Default: OFF

                                        Note Setting this also strips the ELF files in the generated non-dbgsym package, which results in debuginfo only being available in the dbgsym package.
                                        Note Binaries must contain debug symbols before packaging so use either Debug or RelWithDebInfo for CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE variable value.
                                        Additionally, if CPACK_STRIP_FILES is set, the files will be stripped before they get to the DEB generator, so will not contain debug symbols and a dbgsym package will not get built. Do not use with CPACK_STRIP_FILES.
