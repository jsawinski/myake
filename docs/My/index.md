# Myake documentation00## Usage00The general skeleton for a `CMakeLists.txt` file taking advantage of Myake is:00	cmake_minimum_required(3.22)0	0	find_package(Myake QUIET)0	include(My/Init OPTIONAL)0	project(<...>)0	include(My/Config OPTIONAL)00	<...>00	if(Myake_FOUND)0		# ...0	endif()00	include(My/Lists OPTIONAL)00Here, [`My/Init`](Init.md) will initialize and [`My/Config`](Config.md) will 0configure Myake and, as well, load user specific settings from `User/Init` and 0`User\Config`, respectively, which can be used to store personalized settings. 0In the sameway, [`My/Lists`](List.md) (which is recommend to appear at the end 0of the file) loads `User/Lists`, which can be used to add additional configuration, 0such as package generator options. Note, that `OPTIONAL` must be used as Myake 0is not necessarily installed nor it's CMake version requirements are satisfied 0(at the time of writing Myake requires CMake version 3.22 or above).00## Includes00**Utilities**00[My/Bits](Bits.md)  0[My/Platform](Platform.md)  0[My/Build](Build.md)  0[My/Report](Report.md)00**Personalized building**00[My/Init](Init.md)  0[My/Config](Config.md)  0[My/Lists](Lists.md)00**Packaging**00[My/Package](Package.md)  00**External sites**00[My/External](External.md)  0
